## Ingredients
175 grams water
3/4 tsp salt
1/4 tsp instant yeast
2 tsp olive oil
250 grams all purpose flour 

## Recipe
#### The Night Before
Combine water, salt, oil, and yeast in a medium sized bowl (about 2qt or lager). Give it a quick stir with a spoon. Add the flour. Mix it all together with a spoon making sure that no unincorporated flour remains. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it sit on the counter for 8 to 24 hours (overnight works best).

#### 8-24 Hours Later
Preheat oven to 450° Fahrenheit. Use a spoon (or your hands) to knock the air out of the dough and form it into a rough ball. Flour your work surface and shape the dough into a rough circle by pressing inside to out, forming a small crust along the edge. If the dough tightens and fights back, constricting itself, let it sit for 5-10 minutes to relax then come back and try to stretch it out more. You’re aiming for about a 14-16 inch diameter circle. Add your toppings, bake for ~15 minutes depending on density of toppings. Try to go light as the more toppings you add, you risk sogging out the dough. I recommend about 3 tbsp of your favorite canned crushed tomatoes (salted to taste), a generous sprinkling all over of freshly grated whole milk low moisture mozzarella cheese, mushrooms and black olives for a vegetarian option, or pepperoni for a non-vegetarian option.
