## Ingredients
2 Tbsp. oyster sauce
2 Tbsp. dark soy sauce
1 Tbsp. unseasoned rice vinegar
4 Fresno peppers
4-6 garlic cloves, pressed
1/2 onion, sliced
1 red bell pepper, sliced 
1 bunch of Thai basil
1-2 roma tomatoes, quartered
1 Tbsp. vegetable oil
1 lb. ground pork
12 oz. wide rice noodles
Chili oil (optional, for garnish)
Roasted sesame seeds (optional, for garnish)

## Recipe
Prepare the rice noodles by soaking them in a large bowl of hot tap water for about 20 minutes.

Heat the oil in a wok or large skillet or dutch oven over medium to medium high heat. Add the pork and cook while breaking up the meat with tongs until cooked through, about 5 minutes. Remove the pork from the pan.

Add the onion and bell pepper to the pan and cook for about 2 minutes until slightly softened. Add the fresno pepper and garlic and cook for 1 minute until fragrant. Add the cooked pork, cooked rice noodles, roma tomatoes, oyster sauce, dark soy sauce, rice vinegar, and half of the basil, stirring occasionally until the sauce clings to the noodles (2-5 minutes). If the sauce tightens up before the noodles have fully finished cooking, you can add a splash of extra water, about 1/4 cup usually does the trick depending on how thick your rice noodles are.

Salt to taste and serve with more thai basil, roasted sesame seeds, and chili oil.
