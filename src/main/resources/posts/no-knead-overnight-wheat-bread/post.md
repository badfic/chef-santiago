## Ingredients
400 grams water
11 grams sea salt
1/2 tsp instant yeast
400 grams all purpose flour 
200 grams whole wheat flour

## Recipe
#### The Night Before
Combine water, salt, and yeast in a medium sized bowl (about 2qt or lager). Give it a quick stir with a spoon. Add both flours. Mix it all together with a spoon (or your hands) making sure that no unincorporated flour remains. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it sit on the counter for 8 to 24 hours (overnight works best).

#### 8-24 Hours Later
Preheat oven to 450° Fahrenheit with a cast iron dutch oven inside of it.

Use a spoon (or your hands) to knock the air out of the dough and form it into a rough ball. Lightly flour your work surface and place the dough on it. [Follow this guide for shaping your dough.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWA0RAAsBHg) If you have a round banneton, place the dough into a lightly floured round banneton and cover with a lint free towel for 35 minutes while the oven is preheating. If you don't have a banneton, consider a shallow bowl or plate with sides that roughly matches the size of your loaf. You can spray the bowl or plate with nonstick spray or dust it in flour if you are afraid of sticking. Similarly, cover your bowl or plate with a lint free towel and wait 35 minutes while your oven is preheating.

After 35 minutes, remove dutch oven from oven and gently place the dough, seam side up, into the dutch oven. Cover the dutch oven, and bake covered for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes remove the cover of the dutch oven and bake for an additional 3-15 minutes, or until the dough registers between 190 and 200° Fahrenheit with an instant read thermometer in the middle and the crust is to your desired color and texture. Let cool on a wire rack for at least 1 hour before slicing.
