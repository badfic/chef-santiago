## Ingredients

#### Sauce
4 Tbsp. peanut butter (any variety, crunchy or creamy)
4 Tbsp. soy sauce
2 Tbsp. unseasoned rice vinegar
2 Tbsp. Aji-mirin (or substitute with 1 Tbsp. sugar)
1 Tbsp. sambal oelek (more or less, to taste)
1 cup of water


#### Everything Else
12 oz. large rice noodles
1 Tbsp. vegetable oil
1 lb. ground pork
1 Tbsp. ginger paste (or substitute with minced ginger)
4-6 garlic cloves, pressed
1 10 oz. bag of pre-cut and pre-washed country greens
Roasted sesame seeds (optional, for garnish)
Chili oil (optional, for garnish)


## Recipe
Prepare the rice noodles by soaking them in a large bowl of hot tap water for about 20 minutes.

Into a small to medium bowl add the peanut butter, soy sauce, rice vinegar, sugar, sambal oelek, and water. Stir to combine, don't worry if the sauce is lumpy.

Heat the oil in a large skillet with some depth or a dutch oven over medium to medium high heat. Cook pork, breaking up with tongs, until nearly cooked through, about 5 minutes.  Add ginger and garlic and cook until fragrant (about a minute). Add the greens, in batches if necessary, and cook until just wilted.

Drain the noodles then add them to the pot along with the sauce. Cook, stirring or tossing occasionally until the noodles are al dente and the sauce has thickened and clings to the noodles, about 3-5 minutes. If the sauce tightens up before the noodles have fully finished cooking, you can add a splash of extra water, about 1/4 to 1/2 cup usually does the trick depending on how thick your rice noodles are.

Season to taste with salt and plate the dish, garnishing with sesame seeds and chili oil if desired.
