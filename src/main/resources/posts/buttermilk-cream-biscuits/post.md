## Ingredients
2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting
1 1/2 tbsp baking powder
1 tsp kosher salt
1 tbsp sugar
1 1/2 cups buttermilk

## Recipe
Preheat oven to 400°F

In a large bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar.

Add buttermilk and stir gently with a wooden spoon until dry ingredients are just moistened.

Turn out dough onto a lighted floured work surface. Using your hands, fold it one or two times so it becomes a cohesive mass and press it down to an even 3/4-inch thickness. Using a 3-inch round cookie-cutter (or a glass), cut out biscuits as closely together as possible. Gather together scraps, pat down, and cut out more biscuits. Discard any remaining scraps.

Place biscuits on a parchment paper lined sheet pan

Bake the biscuits in a 400°F oven until risen and golden and an internal temperature of about 190°F, about 15-25 minutes. (Optionally you can bake for 15 minutes on the bottom rack, then move them to the top rack for the last 5-10 minutes. This can help make sure you get an even golden color on both the tops and bottoms of the biscuits)

Let cool slightly and serve warm.
